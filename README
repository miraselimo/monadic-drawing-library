REAME under construction ..

This submission contain a library called Draw.hs and four example programs, 
example1.hs, example2.hs, example3.hs and example4.hs.

To run just load any of the example in ghci and then execute main.Each of them produces a 
jpg image file.
e.g. 
ghci
-> :l example1.hs
-> main

I'm also including one Haskell script called extend.hs, should you want to try different          
operations. Uncomment the code in main and uncomment perform and its definition, then add
operations.
